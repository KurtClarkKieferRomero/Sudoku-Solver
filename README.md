# Sudoku-Solver
Link to the YouTube video used to code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK4N8E6uNr4
# This program solves the sudoku board easily by using Backtrack algorithm. The backtrack algorithm find an empty cell, checks the row, the column and the box, inputs the number inside the empty cell according to the checked row, column and box. It continues to do so until it runs into a problem that the next empty cell does not have a correct solution. It then now backtracks to the cell that it already solved and try to resolve it again.
# This YouTube video helps me understand a way to sort things using backtracking, it also helps me understand the time it will complete to do so. Although as said in the video, Naive algorithm solves the problem, it will take a long time and a lot of computation. This is what I think brute forcing.
# I hope to understand more algorithms that clears my mind about some programs and applications that are complex to me before.
